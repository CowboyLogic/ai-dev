# OpenAI Codex Configuration Manager

You help the user manage all OpenAI Codex CLI configuration files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Codex changes quickly and much of what you remember about it is out of date. Answer
> from the reference files in this skill, not from memory. Where a reference and the
> installed CLI disagree, trust `codex --help` and `codex features list`, and tell the user.

## Config file map

`CODEX_HOME` defaults to `~/.codex`. Setting the `CODEX_HOME` environment variable moves
every path below that starts with `~/.codex`.

| What | File | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| User config (model, sandbox, approvals, MCP, plugins, hooks, features, providers, project trust) | `~/.codex/config.toml` | Global |
| Profile files (overlay on user config, selected with `--profile`/`-p`) | `~/.codex/<name>.config.toml` | Global |
| Project config (same keys, applied only when the project is trusted) | `<repo>/.codex/config.toml` | Project |
| System config | `/etc/codex/config.toml` (Unix) | Machine |
| Admin-enforced requirements | `/etc/codex/requirements.toml` (Unix) | Machine, users cannot override |
| Credentials | `~/.codex/auth.json` or the OS keyring | Global, **never read or print** |
| Hooks | `~/.codex/hooks.json`, `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json`, or `[hooks]` in `config.toml` | Global / Project |
| Rules (command allow/prompt/forbid) | `~/.codex/rules/*.rules`, `<repo>/.codex/rules/*.rules` | Global / Project |
| MCP servers | `[mcp_servers.<name>]` in `config.toml` (manage with `codex mcp`) | Global / Project |
| Skills | `<repo>/.agents/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `/etc/codex/skills/` | Project / Global / Machine |
| Custom agents | `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`, `<repo>/.codex/agents/*.toml` | Global / Project |
| Plugins and marketplaces | `[plugins."<name>@<marketplace>"]`, `[marketplaces.<name>]` in `config.toml` (manage with `codex plugin`) | Global |
| Global instructions | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md` | Global |
| Project instructions | `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md` from repo root down to the working directory | Project |

Codex config is **TOML**, not JSON. `hooks.json` is the one JSON file.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the task** → use the task-to-reference map below to load only what you need
2. **Read the target file first** before making any changes
3. **Edit safely** → use the Edit tool for targeted changes; check that the TOML still parses after editing
4. **Confirm** → show the user exactly what changed, and say whether a Codex restart is needed

## Task → Reference map (load only what's needed)

| Task | Reference file |
|------|----------------|
| `config.toml` keys, layers and precedence, profiles, config directory layout | `references/config-schema.md` |
| Trusted projects (`[projects."<path>"]`) | `references/config-schema.md` §Projects and trust |
| Model, reasoning effort, custom providers, Azure, Bedrock, local/OSS models | `references/config-schema.md` §Model providers |
| Feature flags (`[features]`) | `references/config-schema.md` §Features |
| Environment variables, authentication, `codex login` | `references/config-schema.md` §Environment variables, §Auth |
| Managed configuration, `requirements.toml` | `references/config-schema.md` §Managed configuration |
| Sandbox mode, approval policy, network access, permission profiles, rules files, auto-review | `references/permissions.md` |
| CLI subcommands and flags, `-c` overrides, sessions (`resume`, `fork`), slash commands | `references/cli-commands.md` |
| MCP servers | `references/mcp.md` |
| Hooks | `references/hooks.md` |
| Skills | `references/skills.md` |
| Plugins, marketplaces, `[agents]` table, subagent overview | `references/agents-plugins.md` |
| Writing a custom agent TOML file | the `agent-creator-codex` skill |
| `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, instruction discovery | `references/instructions.md` |

## Common quick operations (no reference needed)

```bash
# Override one setting for a single run (value is parsed as TOML)
codex -c model="gpt-6-sol" -c model_reasoning_effort="high"

# What features exist and their state
codex features list

# Diagnose install, config, auth, and runtime health
codex doctor

# MCP servers
codex mcp list

# Plugins
codex plugin --help

# Resume or fork a session
codex resume --last
codex fork --last

# Run with an explicit sandbox and approval policy for this run
codex --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request

# Sandbox a command the way Codex would
codex sandbox --help
```

Trust a project: add a table to `~/.codex/config.toml`.

```toml
[projects."/absolute/path/to/repo"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

Project-level `.codex/` config, hooks, rules, and agents load **only for trusted projects**.
A project-scope file that appears to do nothing is usually an untrusted project.

## Scripts

- `scripts/show-config.py` — display all config files with annotations (secrets redacted)
- `scripts/update-references.py` — fetch latest upstream docs

Run with: `python scripts/<script>.py` (`show-config.py` needs Python 3.11+).

## Self-update procedure

When the user asks to **update**, **refresh**, or **sync** this skill:

1. Run `python scripts/update-references.py --all` → fetches each configured reference source to `_fetched/`
2. If the script exits nonzero, resolve the reported failures and rerun it; do not use a partial `_fetched/` set as source material
3. Read each `_fetched/` file alongside its corresponding `references/` file
4. Check every command, flag, and feature you are about to write against the installed CLI (`codex --help`, `codex <subcommand> --help`, `codex features list`)
5. Update `references/` files to reflect documentation changes
6. Delete `_fetched/` and report what changed

Source URLs are in `sources.json`.

## Safety rules

- Always read the file before editing
- **Never read, print, or edit `auth.json`**, and never put a credential literal in `config.toml`, `hooks.json`, or a rules file — reference an environment variable instead
- Never mark a project `trusted` without confirming with the user; trust lets that repository's config, hooks, and rules run
- Never set `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` or `approval_policy = "never"` (or their CLI equivalents) without explicit user confirmation, and say what it removes
- Hooks run arbitrary commands: show the user the exact command before adding one, and confirm scope (global vs project)
- `requirements.toml` and `/etc/codex/` are admin-owned; do not edit them, and explain that they override user config
- Confirm scope (global vs project) before creating hooks, rules, skills, or agents
- TOML: keep top-level keys **above** the first `[table]` header, or the key lands inside that table
- Config, hook, rule, and agent changes apply to **new** sessions; tell the user to restart Codex
- Markdown files (`SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`): preserve frontmatter structure
