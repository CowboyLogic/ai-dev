name: skill-router
description: Find an installed skill in the skill library, a folder of skills kept outside the harness's discovery path so their descriptions do not load into every session. Search it BEFORE starting a task that a specialized skill could cover and that no skill already listed in this session fits, and whenever the user names a skill you cannot see or asks what skills are installed. Returns the skill's directory so you can read and follow it. Also use it when the user asks to install, update, review, or remove a skill in the library.

# Skill Router

The skills listed in this session are not all the skills installed. Most live in a
library that the harness does not scan, so that their descriptions cost nothing until
one is needed. Search the library, then load the one skill that fits.

The script is `scripts/skill_router.py` in this skill's directory. It is
standard-library Python and needs Python 3.12 or later. Run it with `uv run`, which picks
a suitable Python whatever the system default is. Without `uv`, run it with a `python3` or
`python` that is 3.12 or later.

## 1. Search

```bash
uv run <this-skill-dir>/scripts/skill_router.py search <words describing the task>
```

Describe the task with the words a skill author would use: the tool, the file type, the
kind of work. `search terraform module review` works better than
`search check my infrastructure code`.

Each result gives a name, a directory, and the start of the description:

```text
1. terraform-module-review
   dir:  /home/me/.skill-library/work-skills/skills/terraform-module-review
   desc: Review a Terraform module for drift, unsafe defaults, and ...
```

Search is by keyword, so a miss can mean the wrong words and not a missing skill. If
nothing fits, search **once more** with different words, such as a synonym, the tool's
name, or a broader term. Two misses mean the library has no skill for this.

When the user names a skill, search for that name. A skill whose name is the query comes
first, marked `(exact name)`. Two results with that mark are two copies of the skill in
different directories: ask the user which to use unless one is plainly the right source.

Add `--json` for full descriptions when the shortened ones are not enough to choose.

## 2. Load the skill

Pick the result whose description fits the task. If none fits, load none: a poor match
costs more than it saves.

1. Read `SKILL.md` in the result's `dir` and follow it as you would any skill.
2. Treat `dir` as that skill's base directory. Every relative path the skill mentions,
   such as `references/guide.md` or `scripts/run.py`, resolves against `dir`, not against
   your working directory.
3. Run the skill's scripts by their full path under `dir`. Do not change your working
   directory to do it, and do not copy the skill into the workspace.

A result can carry a `note:` line naming text such as `$ARGUMENTS` that a harness fills
in when it loads a skill itself. Here it stays literal. Substitute it yourself:
`$ARGUMENTS` is what the user asked for, and a skill-directory variable is `dir`.

## 3. When nothing fits

Tell the user the library has no skill for the task and carry on without one. Do not
install a skill from a remote source on your own. Adding to the library is the user's
decision; when they make it, install as described below.

## 4. Manage the library

These commands change the library, and `install` and `update` need the GitHub CLI (`gh`).
Run them when the user asks, not on your own.

Any command can print a notice on stderr that begins `skill-router:`. Two of them are for
the user, so pass them on: the library was initialized, or skills are waiting for review.

### Install a skill

Always install into the library with this command, never with an installer that writes to
a harness's skill directories.

```bash
uv run <this-skill-dir>/scripts/skill_router.py install <owner/repo> <skill>
```

Use `--all` in place of the skill name for every skill in the repository, and `--pin <ref>`
to hold a skill at a tag or commit.

Nothing is installed until the user has approved the source:

1. Run the command. If it exits with status 3, it has printed a summary: the source, the
   version, a tree value, and the files, with scripts marked.
2. Show the user that summary and ask two things: do they trust this source, and how far.
   The choices are this skill only, everything in the repository, or everything from the
   owner. Do not answer for them, and do not suggest the wider choices as a convenience.
3. Run the same command again with their answer:
   `--approved-by-user --scope skill|repo|owner --expect-tree <tree value>`, or `--deny`.

`--approved-by-user` states that the user said yes to that summary in this conversation.
Never pass it on any other basis. If the command reports that the tree has changed, the
source changed after the summary was shown: show the new summary and ask again.

A denied skill is refused from then on. Pass `--reconsider` only when the user asks for
that skill again. A skill covered by an earlier approval installs with no question.

### Review skills that arrived another way

A skill put in the library by hand, or with another tool, is left out of search results
until the user has reviewed it. When a command says skills are waiting:

```bash
uv run <this-skill-dir>/scripts/skill_router.py review
```

Show the user the list and ask, for each skill, whether they put it there. Then run
`review` again with their answers: `--approve <skill>...` for the ones they did,
`--approve-dir <dir>` when a whole directory in the library is theirs, `--approve-all` when
all of them are, and `--delete <skill>...` for the ones they did not. `--delete` removes
the folder, so use it only on a clear no.

### Update, remove, and inspect

- `update` brings every library skill up to date from its source and asks nothing.
  `update --check` reports what would change. Skills pinned to a version, and skills with
  no recorded source, are skipped and named. Run it when the user asks, or suggest it when
  they mention a skill is out of date.
- `remove <skill> --yes` deletes a skill's folder. Ask the user first and pass `--yes` only
  on their yes.
- `status` lists every skill with its source, version, and approval, then the wider
  approvals and the denied skills.

## Other commands

- `list` prints the name of every skill in the library. Use it when the user asks what is
  installed. With hundreds of skills the output is long, so prefer `search` when the user
  wants a skill for a particular task.
- `index` refreshes the index and reports on the library: the skill count, skills with
  no description, names used twice, and skills that use harness-only variables. `search`
  refreshes the index itself, so this is for inspection, not a required step.
- `topics` prints the words most common across skill names. `topics --write` puts them at
  the end of this skill's own description, which tells a future session what the library
  covers. Run it only when the user asks.

The library is `~/.skill-library` unless `SKILL_ROUTER_LIBRARY` or `--library <path>`
names another directory.
