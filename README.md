## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for:

- **AI Agent Configurations**: Ready-to-use configurations for various AI development agents and assistants
- **Tool Integration**: Settings and configurations for integrating AI tools into development environments
- **Best Practices**: Documented patterns and approaches for working with AI coding assistants
- **Shared Resources**: A collaborative space to store and share AI development configurations with the community

## Structure

- **`agents/`** - Configuration files and documentation for AI agents
- **`opencode/`** - OpenCode-specific configurations and samples
- **`mcp/`** - Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations
  - `sample-configs/` - Example configuration files for different MCP setups

## Getting Started

Browse the directories to find configuration files relevant to your development environment. Each configuration typically includes:

- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Customization options
- Integration guidelines

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have configurations or patterns that have improved your AI-assisted development workflow, feel free to share them here.

## Documentation

- See `AGENTS.md` files in respective directories for detailed documentation on specific agents and their configurations
- Check individual configuration files for inline documentation and usage notes
