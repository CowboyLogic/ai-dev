# AI Agents Overview

This directory contains documentation for custom AI agents designed to assist with various development tasks. AI agents are specialized AI systems that can perform automated tasks, provide assistance, and enhance productivity in software development workflows.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are intelligent systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of software development, they can help with code generation, review, testing, documentation, and more.

For authoritative information on AI agents, refer to:
